# Kubernetes The Hard Way - My scripts

While attending to LFS258 Kubernetes Fundamentals class, I had to approach the (Kubernetes The Hard Way tutorial by Kelsey Hightower)[https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way].

In this repo I collect all scripts I developed following Kelsey's instructions.

This is a case study only, not intendet to be easily reproducible nor supported.
